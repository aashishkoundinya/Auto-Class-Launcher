# Auto-Class-Launcher
Opens your online class from a website from a .exe

This program will open a website set by you and automatically perform clicks whereever you like it to!
1. Add the WEBSITE URL in the "INSERT URL HERE" in the code.
2. Set the X,Y coordinates of the place where the code needs to perform a click on the website.
3. Replicate the "SetCursorPos" if you want it to perform multiple clicks in a sequence.
4. Add "mouse_event( MOUSEEVENTF_LEFTDOWN, 0, 0, 0, 0 );"  "mouse_event( MOUSEEVENTF_LEFTUP, 0, 0, 0, 0 );" after "SetCursorPos" for it to perform the mouse click.
5. That's it!!

If you dont need to add any new "SetCursorPos" then just insert the "URL" and the "X,Y coordinates" and run the program.

Enjoy the automated program!!
